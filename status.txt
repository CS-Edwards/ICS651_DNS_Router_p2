SYSTEM: Ubuntu Linux
Status: runs with bug

BUGS:
1: Resource records linked list: if multiple domain.name/ip.address entered in main, last file over-writes previous record

2: Parsing Query: dns header struct,question struct does not parse from query buffer correctly (compared to wireshark values)

3: Reply to query: sends malformed reply to query with correct transaction ID (see in wireshark)

TESTING :
1: DIG : server accepts DIG queries 
2: COMMAND LINE: accepts arguments from main
3: DIG: can partially parse query (wireshark)
4: REPLY: can send partial DIG Reply  
5: QUERY+RESOURCE RECORD MATCH: able to identify matching record for queried url name.
